# It's Magic


### Note
We apologize for the state of the repository, we threw this repo together for a Data Science Lab project. Cleaning will be done when we return from break (hopefully). If you need help understanding anything please feel free to reach out to us. Email: samuel.h.zhang (at) utexas.edu

Most .py and .ipynb are scripts to scrape or process data. A few exceptions are for generating models/data.

### Acknowledgements
Thank you to [Top8Draft.com](http://top8draft.com) for providing us all of our draft and deck data.

We built our LDA notebook/model off of [this notebook](https://github.com/hlynurd/lda-for-magic/blob/master/lda-mtg-notebook.ipynb).

We used the [Scryfall API](https://api.scryfall.com) for card images and card info.
